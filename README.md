# voidMod
voided's assorted stupid ideas, testing, and messing about with LiteLoader and SpongePowered Mixins. Woohoo!
Some code from MCP 1.4.7 (Crash Report Code)
Note: Compiled litemod is known to not work properly with old "pre-1.6.4" crash reports - the Mixin that adds it is never applied. :(
This is a stupid idea and is not guaranteed to work.

Press DOWN while ingame to crash the game. Configurable via options.
There are LOTS of known bugs/issues that I could NOT be bothered to fix at the moment.
Some Include (might not be updated):
- Some crashes may or may not freeze the crash screen.
- Not sure about "pre-1.6.4", but closing the game after a crash exits with code 0 instead of a non-zero exit code. Lazy coding on my part, since I just did System.exit(0).

Also, all players / npcs / similar are rendered with jeb_ sheep rendering. Enjoy.
